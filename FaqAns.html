                    The breeding system used in this farm is CONTROLLED MATING. This is when the doe is taken to the buck for mating. Then after mating, the date of mating is being recorded and the delivery date is being noted also. The length of pregnancy in the rabbit is 31 days and the doe can produce from 1 to 12 young each time she gives birth. She can become pregnant again within a few days of giving birth. The record is being taken by the manager and its being recorded in a book and on a wall board which is refers to as RECORD KEEPING.
